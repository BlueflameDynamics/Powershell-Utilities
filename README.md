# Powershell Utilities

My name is Randy Turner, I'm a retired Developer\Programmer with 50 years of experience in standalone & network applications development, and network administration.

The purpose of this repository is to share many of my most popular Powershell Utilities and Scripts
created since Powershell was first released.

This repository includes a collection of Powershell Utilities and Scripts many of which may be used
as reusable modules via the Import-Module command in building more complex scripts. One such script is
the 'WinFormsLibrary.ps1' which includes functions for many common Windows WinForm dialogs.

The repository contains folders for each application and a ZipFiles folder as a library of the projects.

I've also included both a 32-bit & 64-bit version of my PSRun3 Windows Powershell Host application, which provides a means of running Windows Powershell sceipts without a console window. For command syntax run: 
PSRun3.exe -help
